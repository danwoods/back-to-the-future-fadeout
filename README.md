# back-to-the-future-fadeout

This is a sample project for Wikimedia, showcasing a fade-out-technique.

## To Run
* These are simple static files, so any server should work. If you don't have a static file server locally installed, check out [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

* Once files are being served, the routes of interest are `/`, `/css.html`, and `/image.html`

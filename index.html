      Gertrude Käsebier (May 18, 1852 – October 12, 1934) was an American
      photographer who was known for her images of motherhood and her portraits
      of Native Americans; her portraits of the Sioux focused more on the
      expression and individuality of the person than their costumes and
      customs. She helped establish the Women's Professional Photographers
      Association of America and promoted photography as a career for women.
